### Loan Prediction and Its Impact on Profits

One of the most fundamental challenges faced by banks and financial institutions revolves around accurately predicting loan outcomes, as this has a profound impact on their profitability. Despite the existence of several established methods for analyzing loan applications, many of these methods seem to be inadequate, particularly in light of the reported increase in the number of subprime loans.

### Utilizing Gradient Boosting Techniques

To address this challenge, this study employs a sophisticated machine learning technique known as Gradient Boosting, specifically utilizing Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to forecast the likelihood of loan default. This advanced approach offers improved performance compared to traditional methods, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of loan default predictions.

### Leveraging Statistics from Super Lender

Drawing upon lending statistics provided by the online lending firm Super Lender, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis that encompasses both demographic data and information extracted from loan applications. By leveraging this rich dataset, the study aims to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing loan default and improve the effectiveness of predictive modeling.

### Evaluation Metrics

Key evaluation metrics, including F1-Score, Accuracy, Recall, and Precision, are meticulously examined to assess the predictive performance of the model. These metrics provide comprehensive insights into the model's ability to effectively identify and classify risky loan applicants, thereby enabling financial institutions to make informed decisions.

### Strengthening Loan Credit Approval Processes

By effectively identifying and categorizing risky clients from a vast pool of loan applications, this study lays a solid foundation for loan credit approval processes. The predictive modeling approach proposed in this study equips financial institutions with a robust tool to mitigate risks associated with loan default, thereby enhancing overall lending practices and safeguarding profitability.
